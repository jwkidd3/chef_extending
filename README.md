# Extending Cookbooks Repository

This repository contains all the cookbooks and content necessary to complete the exercises defined for Extending Cookbooks. This allows the learners to focus on the activities defined for the workshop and not have to write every line of code to get to the important parts for the training.

* The httpd cookbook is setup to test with the Docker  Test Kitchen Driver.
